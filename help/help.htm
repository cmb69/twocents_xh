<p>Twocents_XH allows your visitors to add their two cents. ;) You can use it as
a general commenting possibility on multiple pages, or as a guestbook on a
single page, or both, and it can be used as comments plugin for <a
href="http://3-magi.net/?CMSimple_XH/Realblog_XH">Realblog_XH</a>. As markup
language a minimal subset of HTML is optionally available, which can be entered
with a simple WYSIWYG editor.</p>
<p>Optionally you can enable comment moderation (i.e. comments will not be
published automatically), be notified about new comments via email, and you can
add spam prevention by using a <a
href="http://www.cmsimple-xh.org/wiki/doku.php/captcha_plugins">conforming
CAPTCHA plugin</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Please do read this documentation <em>before</em> you encounter any
problems!</strong></p>

<h2 id="notice">Important Notice</h2>
<p><strong>Twocents_XH is merely a draft&mdash;many features are missing yet,
and what is there might change. It is a so called alpha version. Use with utmost
caution!</strong></p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>Twocents_XH is a plugin for CMSimple_XH. It requires CMSimple_XH &ge; 1.6 and
PHP &ge; 5.1.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>The installation is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins.
See the <a href="http://www.cmsimple-xh.org/wiki/doku.php/installation">
CMSimple_XH wiki</a> for further details.</p>
<ol>
<li>Backup the data on your server.</li>
<li>Unzip the distribution on your computer.</li>
<li>Upload the whole directory twocents/ to your server into CMSimple_XH's
plugins/ directory.</li>
<li>Set write permissions for the subdirectories css/, config/, languages/ and
htmlpurifier/standalone/HTMLPurifier/DefinitionCache/Serializer/.</li>
<!--<li>Browse to Twocents's administration (Plugins &rarr; Twocents), and check
if all requirements are fulfilled.</li>-->
</ol>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
<p>The plugin's configuration is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins in
the website's back-end. Select "Twocents" from "Plugins".</p>
<!--<p>You can change the default settings of Twocents_XH under "Config". Hints for
the options will be displayed when hovering over the help icon with your
mouse.</p>-->
<p>Localization is done under "Language". You can translate the character
strings to your own language (if there is no appropriate language file
available), or customize them according to your needs.</p>
<p>The look of Twocents_XH can be customized under "Stylesheet".</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>To place a comment facility on a page, write:</p>
<pre>{{{twocents('%TOPICNAME%');}}}</pre>
<p>%TOPICNAME% can be an arbitrary name, but it may contain only the letters
a-z, the digits 0-9 and minus signs (-). The topicname is not necessarily
related to the page heading; in fact it is just the name of a file that is
stored in the subfolder twocents/ of CMSimple_XH's content folder. If you like
you can display the comments for the same topic on different pages.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<pre>{{{twocents('guestbook');}}}
{{{twocents('article-1');}}}</pre>
<p>Note that there must be at most one call of twocents on a single page.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h3 id="usage-admin">Administration</h2>
<p>The administration of the comments happens on the pages where the comments
are displayed. When you're logged in as administrator, you'll see buttons to
edit, hide/show and delete each comment.</p>
<p>In the plugin administration area you can convert existing comments from
resp. to HTML, depending on the setting of the configuration option Comments
&rarr; Markup. Note that it's best to do this only when the site is in
maintenance mode, and that you have to change this configuration option after
the conversion.</p>
<p>Furthermore there is the possibility to import comments from the Comments
plugin. To use this, you have to copy the data files of the Comments plugin into
Twocents_XH's data folder. Note that some of the information will be ignored,
e.g. the IP address and the uploaded image, as well as the markup when
Twocents_XH is in plain text mode.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Currently, posting comments from very old browsers such as IE 6 and IE 7 is
not possible; the form submission will silently fail.</p>
<p>Twocents_XH uses HTML5 form validation features. These will be critized by
validators for HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 templates. Other than that they cause no
harm; old browsers will simply ignore them, and contemporary browsers will
heed them nonetheless.</p>
