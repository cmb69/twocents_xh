<p>
    Twocents_XH allows your visitors to add their two cents. ;) You can use it
    as a general commenting possibility on multiple pages, or as a guestbook on
    a single page, or both, and it can be used as comments plugin for <a
    href="http://3-magi.net/?CMSimple_XH/Realblog_XH">Realblog_XH</a>. As markup
    language a minimal subset of <abbr title="Hypertext Markup
    Language">HTML</abbr> is optionally available, which can be entered with a
    simple <abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> editor.
</p>
<p>
    Optionally you can enable comment moderation (i.e. comments will not be
    published automatically), be notified about new comments via email, and you
    can add spam prevention by using a <a
    href="http://www.cmsimple-xh.org/wiki/doku.php/captcha_plugins">conforming
    <abbr title="Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and
    Humans Apart">CAPTCHA</abbr> plugin</a> and a simple bad-word list.

<h2>Important Notice</h2>
<p class="important">
    Twocents_XH couldn't be tested so far in various environments. It is a so
    called beta version. Use with caution!
</p>
</section>

<section id="requirements">
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>
    Twocents_XH is a plugin for CMSimple_XH ≥ 1.6.3 and <abbr title="PHP:
    Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> ≥ 5.4.0 with the <i>JSON</i> extension
    installed.
</p>
</section>

<section id="installation">
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
    The installation is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins. See the <a
    href="http://www.cmsimple-xh.org/wiki/doku.php/installation"> CMSimple_XH
    wiki</a> for further details.
</p>
<ol>
<li class="important">
    Backup the data on your server.
</li>
<li>
    Unzip the distribution on your computer.
</li>

    Upload the whole directory <code>twocents/</code> to your server into
    CMSimple_XH's <code>plugins/</code> directory.

    Set write permissions for the subdirectories <code>cache/</code>,
    <code>css/</code>, <code>config/</code> and <code>languages/</code>.

<li class="important">

    fulfilled.
</li>
</ol>
</section>

<section id="settings">
<h2>Settings</h2>
<p>
    The plugin's configuration is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins in
    the website's back-end. Select <i>Plugins</i> → <i>Twocents</i>.
</p>
<p>
    You can change the default settings of Twocents_XH under <i>Config</i>.
    Hints for the options will be displayed when hovering over the help icon
    with your mouse.
</p>
<p>
    Localization is done under <i>Language</i>. You can translate the character
    strings to your own language (if there is no appropriate language file
    available), or customize them according to your needs.
</p>
<p>
    The look of Twocents_XH can be customized under <i>Stylesheet</i>.
</p>
</section>

<section id="usage">
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
    To place a comment facility on a page, write:
</p>
<pre>{{{twocents('%TOPICNAME%')}}}</pre>
<p>
    <code>%TOPICNAME%</code> can be an arbitrary name, but it may contain only
    the letters <code>a</code>-<code>z</code>, the digits
    <code>0</code>-<code>9</code> and minus signs (<code>-</code>). The
    topicname is not necessarily related to the page heading; in fact it is just
    the name of a file that is stored in the subfolder <code>twocents/</code> of
    CMSimple_XH's content folder. If you like you can display the comments for
    the same topic on different pages.
</p>
<p>
    Some examples:
</p>
<pre>{{{twocents('guestbook')}}}
{{{twocents('article-1')}}}</pre>
<p>
    To mark a certain topic as read-only, so that only the administrator is able
    to add comments, pass <code>1</code> as second argument to the function,
    for instance:
</p>
<pre>{{{twocents('archived', 1}}}</pre>
<p>
    Note that there must be at most one call of twocents on a single page.
</p>
<p>
    You can configure the very simplistic spam protection in the language
    settings under <i>Spam</i> → <i>Words</i> which a list of comma separated
    words. If any of these words are contained in the message (the actual case
    of the letters doesn't matter), the comment will automatically be hidden.
</p>

<section id="usage-admin">
<h3>Administration</h3>
<p>
    The administration of the comments happens on the pages where the comments
    are displayed. When you're logged in as administrator, you'll see buttons to
    edit, hide/show and delete each comment.
</p>
<p>
    In the plugin administration area you can convert existing comments from
    resp. to HTML, depending on the setting of the configuration option
    <i>Comments</i> → <i>Markup</i>. Note that it's best to do this only when
    the site is in maintenance mode, and that you have to change this
    configuration option after the conversion.
</p>
<p>
    Furthermore there is the possibility to import comments from the <a
    href="https://ge-webdesign.de/cmsimpleplugins/?Eigene_Plugins/Comments">Comments</a>
    and <a href="http://www.qualifire.de/cmsimple/en/?GBook">GBook</a> plugins.
    To use this, you have to copy the data files of the Comments or GBook plugin
    into Twocents_XH's data folder (which is the subfolder
    <code>twocents/</code> of CMSimple_XH's <code>content/</code> folder). Note
    that some of the information will be ignored, e.g. the <abbr title="Internet
    Protocol">IP</abbr> address and the uploaded image, as well as the markup
    when Twocents_XH is in plain text mode.
</p>
</section>

</section>

<section id="limitations">
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>
    Currently, posting comments from very old browsers such as <abbr
    title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> 6 and IE 7 is not possible; the form
    submission will silently fail.
</p>
<p>
    Twocents_XH uses HTML5 form validation features. These will be critized by
    validators for HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 templates. Other than that they cause
    no harm; old browsers will simply ignore them, and contemporary browsers
    will heed them nonetheless. It is recommended that your template uses the
    so-called HTML 5 doctype declaration, anyway.
