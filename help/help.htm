<h1 id="twocents_xh-user-manual">Twocents_XH – User Manual</h1>
<p>Twocents_XH allows your visitors to add their two cents. ;) You can use it as a general commenting possibility on multiple pages, or as a guestbook on a single page, or both, and it can be used as comments plugin for <a href="https://github.com/cmb69/realblog_xh">Realblog_XH</a>. As markup language a minimal subset of HTML is optionally available, which can be entered with a simple WYSIWYG editor.</p>
<p>Optionally you can enable comment moderation (i.e. comments will not be published automatically), be notified about new comments via email, and you can add spam prevention by using a <a href="https://wiki.cmsimple-xh.org/archiv/doku.php/captcha_plugins">conforming CAPTCHA plugin</a> and a simple bad-word list.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>Twocents_XH is a plugin for <a href="https://www.cmsimple-xh.org/">CMSimple_XH</a>. It requires CMSimple_XH ≥ 1.7.0, and PHP ≥ 7.1.0. Twocents_XH also requires the <a href="https://github.com/cmb69/plib_xh">Plib_XH</a> plugin; if that is not already installed (see <em>Settings</em>→<em>Info</em>), get the <a href="https://github.com/cmb69/plib_xh/releases/latest">lastest release</a>, and install it.</p>
<h2 id="download">Download</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/cmb69/twocents_xh/releases/latest">lastest release</a> is available for download on Github.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>The installation is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins. See the <a href="https://wiki.cmsimple-xh.org/?for-users/working-with-the-cms/plugins">CMSimple_XH Wiki</a> for further details.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Backup the data on your server.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Unzip the distribution on your computer.</p></li>
<li><p>Upload the whole directory <code>twocents/</code> to your server into the <code>plugins/</code> directory of CMSimple_XH.</p></li>
<li><p>Set write permissions for the subdirectories <code>cache/</code>, <code>css/</code>, <code>config/</code> and <code>languages/</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Navigate to <code>Plugins</code> → <code>Twocents</code> and check if all requirements are fulfilled.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
<p>The configuration of the plugin is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins in back-end of the Website. Select <code>Plugins</code> → <code>Twocents</code>.</p>
<p>You can change the default settings of Twocents_XH under <code>Config</code>. Hints for the options will be displayed when hovering over the help icon with your mouse.</p>
<p>Localization is done under <code>Language</code>. You can translate the character strings to your own language (if there is no appropriate language file available), or customize them according to your needs.</p>
<p>The look of Twocents_XH can be customized under <code>Stylesheet</code>.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>To place a comment facility on a page, write:</p>
<pre><code>{{{twocents(&#39;%TOPICNAME%&#39;)}}}</code></pre>
<p><code>%TOPICNAME%</code> can be an arbitrary name, but it may contain only the letters <code>a</code>-<code>z</code>, the digits <code>0</code>-<code>9</code> and hyphens (<code>-</code>). The topicname is not necessarily related to the page heading; in fact it is just the name of a file that is stored in the subdirectory <code>twocents/</code> of the <code>content/</code> folder of CMSimple_XH. If you like you can display the comments for the same topic on different pages.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<pre><code>{{{twocents(&#39;guestbook&#39;)}}}
{{{twocents(&#39;article-1&#39;)}}}</code></pre>
<p>To mark a certain topic as read-only, so that only the administrator is able to add comments, pass <code>true</code> as second argument to the function, for instance:</p>
<pre><code>{{{twocents(&#39;archived&#39;, true}}}</code></pre>
<p>Note that there must be at most one call of <code>twocents</code> on a single page.</p>
<p>You can configure the very simplistic spam protection in the language settings under <code>Spam</code> → <code>Words</code> which a list of comma separated words. If any of these words are contained in the message (the actual case of the letters doesn’t matter), the comment will automatically be hidden.</p>
<h3 id="administration">Administration</h3>
<p>The administration of the comments happens on the pages where the comments are displayed. When you are logged in as administrator, you will see buttons to edit, hide/show and delete each comment.</p>
<p>In the plugin administration area you can convert existing comments from and to HTML, respectively, depending on the setting of the configuration option <code>Comments</code> → <code>Markup</code>. Note that it is best to do this only when the site is in maintenance mode, and that you have to change this configuration option after the conversion.</p>
<p>Furthermore there is the possibility to import comments from the <a href="https://ge-webdesign.de/cmsimpleplugins/?Eigene_Plugins___Comments">Comments</a> and GBook plugins. To use this, you have to copy the data files of the Comments or GBook plugin into the data folder of Twocents_XH (which is the subfolder <code>twocents/</code> of the <code>content/</code> folder of CMSimple_XH). Note that some of the information will be ignored, e.g. the IP address and the uploaded image, as well as the markup when Twocents_XH is in plain text mode.</p>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Currently, posting comments from very old browsers such as IE 6 and IE 7 is not possible; the form submission will silently fail.</p>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>Report bugs and ask for support either on <a href="https://github.com/cmb69/twocents_xh/issues">Github</a> or in the <a href="https://cmsimpleforum.com/">CMSimple_XH Forum</a>.</p>
